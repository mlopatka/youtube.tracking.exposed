    An evolving discussion animates journalists and research regarding YouTube accountability. In the beginning, we saw anedoctical statements.

Even a paper, using the same discredited methodology, claims that google successfully filters it out for the English language. Cultural interpretation does not scale well as HTTP services do, and we're skeptical of this work in other languages who received less investment and less influential in Google management too. We design wetest#1 the way it is precisely to compare how the English language fits to measure success, but can't scale without the same investment and cultural embeddings.

      <h3>weTEST Experiment Design</h3>
      <p>Testing a personalization algorithm isn't quick and straightforward, as it seems. The researcher has to define a methodology. This method gives different values to the collected samples because they are only useful to test the assumptions initially made. 
        <br>

        Because wetest wants to be a collaborative experiment, it is smart to develop initial findings without assuming any past research. We'll start with a few concise research questions. 
        <br>
        Inevitability, at the beginning, these question are more technical than focused on studying the political impact of the recommendation algorithms. In this initial phase we focus on developing tools and best practices. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Tracking.exposed goals aren't merely to produce reports, articles, or researches. Yes, we do it, (look at our <a href="/">home</a>, bottom-left); it has been part of our training experience. Algorithm accountability can't be revolutionary if accessible only to data analyst and data protection authority. A bit of knowledge on platform influence, or algorithm literacy, should be in the modern background education, and we want to play with it. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Do you remember, companies taking a bunch of random users and experiment on them? 
          <b>We'll do precisely the opposite</b>: 
          <b>a distributed crowd of random individuals, coordinated to experiment on them!</b>
          Anyone can contribute. Someone with a clean, freshly installed browser, someone else with their Google account logged. Partecipants, during the chosen day, should watch a few videos, and we'll collect the video the platform will recommend. We will run analysis to see how much diverse ends up to be suggested video. 
          <br<br>
          It is the most basic calculus on how much is unique, personalized, the experience the company decide for us.

          Farshad Shadloo, a YouTube spokesman, said the company‚Äôs recommendations aimed to steer people toward authoritative videos that leave them satisfied. He said the company was continually improving the algorithm that generates the recommendations. ‚ÄúOver the past year alone, we‚Äôve launched over 30 different changes to reduce recommendations of borderline content and harmful misinformation, including climate change misinformation and other types of conspiracy videos,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThanks to this change, watchtime this type of content gets from recommendations has dropped by over 70 percent in the U.S.‚Äù

        In commentary such as the one above, there are two pitfalls: <b>a language issue</b>, and a <b>trust issue</b>.
        <br>
        Maybe YT is right, and in English language, for the US audience, Youtube investment might guarantee a quality in content curaction high enough to avoid fines, but would be that true in another language? 
        <br>
        The exploitative business model of surveillance capitalism can't easily scale when the succes metric is the _removal of content troublesome for a precise culture_ because investing in content moderator trained and balanced in every culture in the world seems unfeasable due to high costs.
        <br>
        This first experiment concentrate effort in watching four videos chosen by us, on the same broad topic (covid19), in the four most used langagues in the world.
        <br>
        Regardless of trust, how is credible a company who promise changes, (they are invisible), and the quality assessment of such improvements comes from the same organization? Independent testing, like the one we want to enable, is an option accessible to you, to a class of students, to the FTC and to the DPAs.

    We want to apply the most scientific, open, distributed approach we can aim for
  </h3>
  <p class="enlarged">
    <b>
      Diversity is the key
    </b>, but how exactly?
    <br>
    <br>
    Personalization algorithms, content curation, and targeted experiences are unique for each of us. 
    <br>
    Winning the fight for algorithmic independence (when you retain agency and control on the prioritization filter know as recommendation system), make sense if most of us reach that point. A minority of techno elite, literate enough to fact-check and with the skills to find the right information online, would only reinforce inequality among the people in the information age. Diversity is the key because we collectively should understand how other people are perceiving the public discourse. 
    <br>
    A widely deployed recommendation system should be validated by a public policy. It should be subject to public scrutiny, gauging the impact on all of us. Just in 2020, the goal is not a better society but a fluid business flow in the monopolist's hand.
    <br>
    Algorithm analysis might seems a purely technical effort. But the platform we're operating on (Facebook, youtube, amazon) mixes social constructs with their technology, and implicitly, the limited form of algorithm analysis we can perform via passive observation, inherit complexities typical of political analysis.
    <br>
    <br>
    Now, with wetest#1, <b>we begin with the technical analysis</b>, to build up a knowledge base robust enough to address <b>political and sociological analysis</b>. We can't yet address research questions such as "<i>Does youtube radicalize or not people?</i>" or "<i>are videos with blonde white women prioritized against other demographics? It is true in any region?</i>". We want to coordinate tests with these politically meaningful topics, but we can't yet, they aren't low hanging fruits. Releasing approximative analysis would be detrimental for algorithm literacy and platform accountability. Let's build this community with academics and digital rights defender.
